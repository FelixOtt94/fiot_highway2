# Spectrum Highway Dataset 2 for Interference Classification in GNSS Data

Latest update: 2024-10-30

Project size: 30 GB


## Introduction

We publish the *Spectrum Highway Dataset 2* that was recorded close to a German highway and contains a variety of interference classes in GNSS signals from spectral hardware. For the dataset recording, we developed a hardware setup that captures short, wideband snapshots in both E1 and E6 GNSS bands. This setup is mounted to a bridge over a highway. We place two sensor stations with a distance of 1km next to a highway. The setup records 20ms raw IQ snapshots triggered from the energy with a sample rate of 62.5MHz, an analog bandwidth of 50MHz and an 8bit bit-width. See the following visualization of the highway lanes of the real-world highway dataset 2. The car with integrated jammers drove from north to south and from south to north, each with two lanes (Map of Schandelah near Braunschweig, Germany, GoogleMaps, August 2024):

## Dataset

The folder *data* contains the *Spectrum Highway Dataset 2* with the corresponding labels in *.txt* files for the train-test split. One sample in the text file is defined as for example:

`data/157369.npy 0`

The following figure shows exemplary snapshots of the spectrogram. The dataset contains nine classes.

The following figure visualizes the influence of interferences on the latitutde (top) and longitude (middle) of a smartphone. The jammer and smartphone is integrated in the vehicle. The orange line shows the vehicle reference position. The blue line is the smartphone position. The green (handheld jammer) and red (cigarette lighter) marked backgrounds are the interfered timesteps.
